/**
 * Provides business data stores that stores business data in memory, disk, or network depending
 * on circumstances.
 * <p>
 * Currently, this uses the {@link SmartBusinessDataStore}, which provides data from memory, disk,
 * or network (hence "smart").
 * <p>
 * Note that it is understood that this provider is not needed in the current implementation as we
 * only have 1 data store that handles memory, disk, or network storage. We could create rid of this
 * and just inject the {@link SmartBusinessDataStore} directly into consumers. However, we may
 * decide to provide different data stores given a circumstance. Hence, the purpose of this class.
